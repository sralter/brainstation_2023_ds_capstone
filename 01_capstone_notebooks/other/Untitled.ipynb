    "# Deep Learning Models for BigEarthNet-S2 with 19 Classes\n",
    "This repository contains code to use the [BigEarthNet](http://bigearth.net) Sentinel-2 (denoted as BigEarthNet-S2) archive with the nomenclature of 19 classes for deep learning applications. The nomenclature of 19 classes was defined by interpreting and arranging the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) Level-3 nomenclature based on the properties of Sentinel-2 images. This class nomenclature is the product of a collaboration between the [Direção-Geral do Território](http://www.dgterritorio.pt/) in Lisbon, Portugal and the [Remote Sensing Image Analysis (RSiM)](https://www.rsim.tu-berlin.de/) group at TU Berlin, Germany.\n",

    "## Generation of Training/Test/Validation Splits\n",
    "After downloading the raw images from http://bigearth.net, they need to be prepared for your ML application. We provide the script `prep_splits_19_classes.py` for this purpose. It generates consumable data files (i.e., TFRecord) for training, validation and test splits which are suitable to use with TensorFlow. Suggested splits can be found with corresponding csv files under `splits` folder. The following command line arguments for `prep_splits_19_classes.py` can be specified:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `-r` or `--root_folder`: The root folder containing the raw images you have previously downloaded.\n",
    "* `-o` or `--out_folder`: The output folder where the resulting files will be created.\n",
    "* `-n` or `--splits`: A list of CSV files each of which contains the patch names of corresponding split.\n",
    "* `-l` or `--library`: A flag to indicate for which ML library data files will be prepared: TensorFlow.\n",
    "* `--update_json`: A flag to indicate that this script will also change the original json files of the BigEarthNet-S2 by updating labels \n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script, either the GDAL or the rasterio package should be installed. The TensorFlow package should also be installed. The script is tested with Python 2.7, TensorFlow 1.3, and Ubuntu 16.04. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: BigEarthNet-S2 patches with high density snow, cloud and cloud shadow are not included in the training, test and validation sets constructed by the provided scripts (see the list of patches with seasonal snow [here](http://bigearth.net/static/documents/patches_with_seasonal_snow.csv) and that of cloud and cloud shadow [here](http://bigearth.net/static/documents/patches_with_cloud_and_shadow.csv)). \n",
