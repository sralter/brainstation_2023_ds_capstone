Clip
Note: clip base 005 point layer to sm_bounds_water (/Users/sra/Desktop/Data_Science_2023/_capstone/shapefiles/santa_monica_bounds/sm_bounds_water.shp). This way, the point layer will not have a bias to water, where no fires are present.

Note: this time, I need to create a point layer that does not have fire perimeters overlapping them. This will be a point layer that contains elevation and aspect like the other layer, but has no fire perimeter data appended to it.

Goal: clip orthoimage raster of santa monica mountains to the extent of the fire perimeter layer.
	First, I need to remove records in the perimeter layer that are after 2018, because the orthoimagery is only from 2018-07-22 to 24. This I will do in QGIS for now.
	1. Duplicate santa_monica_fire_perimeters to a new layer, santa_monica_fire_perimeterse_le2018, for less than or equal to 2018. Location: /Users/sra/Desktop/Data_Science_2023/_capstone/00_capstone_data/shapefiles/perimeters_sm/santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018.geojson
	2. Remove records in the attribute table that are from 2019 or later.
	3. Merge polygons so that there is only one polygon to clip to.
		Merge vector layers
			input layers
				santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018
			destination crs (optional)
				project crs: epsg:4326 - wgs 84
			merged
				santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018_merge
				/Users/sra/Desktop/Data_Science_2023/_capstone/00_capstone_data/shapefiles/perimeters_sm/santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018_merge.geojson
		But this didn't seem to work. I will try in python, following the instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61035170/merging-polygon-shapefiles-in-python
		Edit>Edit Geometry>Merge selected features
			That did it!
	4. Follow the instructions here: https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-clip-a-raster-to-a-polygon-or-an-extent-with-python-extract-by-mask/
		I cannot get that to work right now.
		Use tool: clip raster by mask layer
			input layer
				ortho_2018_merge_clip
			mask layer
				santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018_merge
			clipped (mask)
				ortho_2018_sm_fire
				/Users/sra/Desktop/Data_Science_2023/_capstone/00_capstone_data/orthoimagery/2018/ortho_2018_sm_fire.tif
		That didn't work either.
		Try this:
		https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/CSC18/lessons/L6/clipping-raster.html
		Or this:
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ftv6I7G-ys
			Clip Raster by Extent
				input
					ortho_2018_merge_clip
				mask layer
					santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018
				#CRS does not match#
				assign a specified nodata value to output bands
					-9999.0
				clipped (mask)
					/Users/sra/Desktop/Data_Science_2023/_capstone/00_capstone_data/orthoimagery/2018/ortho_2018_sm_fire.tif
				That worked, after about 28 hours.
			Now create the negative of the perimeters using Difference.
				This will be used to clip the raster to have an image where there were no fires.
			The geometry is not valid, it's throwing this error when I clip raster by extent:
				Warning 1: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4
					ERROR 1: Cutline polygon is invalid.
			I will try running v.clean on the extent file. See here: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/112687/fixing-geometry-validity-errors-in-qgis-2
			That didn't work. Now try zero distance buffer.
			Now re-running clip raster by extent:
			Clip Raster by Extent
				input
					ortho_2018_merge_clip
				mask layer
					santa_monica_fire_perimeters_nofire
				#CRS does not match#
				assign a specified nodata value to output bands
					-9999.0
				clipped (mask)
					/Users/sra/Desktop/Data_Science_2023/_capstone/00_capstone_data/orthoimagery/2018/ortho_2018_sm_nofire.tif
	It worked!

Goal: Practice on a smaller scale image analysis with neural networks
Task: extract fire and nofire image from a .tif file.

Goal: make rasters that are wholly from fire or nofire areas, to make the patchifying process easier for the CNN image analysis. I will use the rasters that have black bars around them. This is because these rasters were extracted from polygon masks that weren't perfectly N/S/E/W trending. Since rasters need to be perfectly square, bars were created to make the difference. I chose two areas to serve as nofire locations: one near farms and another in the city. Two areas were used as fire locations and these I thought were from varied landscapes within the mountains.
Tool: tile index and clip raster by mask layer. The tile index creates a polygon from the boundary of the raster-with-the-bars, so that I can use the new polygon to extract a bar-free raster.

Goal: make patches from the .tif fire/nofire images
Tool: select .tif image in layers panel > export > check VRT option, set rows and columns to be 128x128

2023-03-31

Goal: need to match each image in the image analysis step to an ~exact geographic datapoint. This ensures that the model is 1:1. In other words, I want a point created in the center of each image patch.
Tool: Vector>Research>Regular Points.
Notes: Make sure to check the cellsize of the individual image patches, which would have to be created already with the VRT option (this can be found when exporting a file).

Goal: merge the fire and the nofire point sets into two sets
Tool: Vector>Data Management>Merge vector layers
Notes: nofire done. 04-01 update: fire done.

Goal: how to connect the points to the perimeters to see where they overlap
Tool: join attributes by location. I will also have to join attributes that DO NOT overlap by location
	join to features in: santa_monica_fire_perimeters_le2018
		These are all perimeters that are through 2018 because the satellite image that I have is taken from 2018.

Goal: generate a layer of points that do not intersect any polygons. I could use the vector>geoprocessing>difference tool, but I don't have to, since the nofire points are already in areas without any fires. See:
