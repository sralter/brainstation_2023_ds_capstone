Samuel Alter's BrainStation 2023 Data Science Capstone Project  
Spring 2023

## Introduction
For this project, I collected a combination of satellite imagery, topographic data (aspect, elevation, and slope), and historical fire boundaries to train models that would predict wildfire risk (Figure 1). I pro- cessed the data first in QGIS5, an open-source mapping application, and then used Python to process the data.6 I fed the processed data into machine learning and deep learning models to make my predictions.7 I chose to focus on the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, for its relatively man- ageable size, proximity to populated areas, and that it is east-west trending, which makes the topographic analysis easier.
