Samuel Alter's BrainStation 2023 Data Science Capstone Project  
Spring 2023

## Motivation
* Wildfires, or the uncontrolled burning of vegetation, cause enormous damage and loss of life worldwide every year.
* 33 people died and over 4.3 million acres burned in California in 2020 alone.
*   equivalent to the total combined area of Puerto Rico and Rhode Island. Although they are a natural component of some forest ecosystems, wildfire incidents are projected to increase in our warming world. While society transitions to a greener future, there is a clear need to predict where wildfires are likely to occur so that communities can protect themselves and evacuate when necessary.

## Introduction
For this project, I collected a combination of satellite imagery, topographic data (aspect, elevation, and slope), and historical fire boundaries to train models that would predict wildfire risk (Figure 1). I processed the data first in QGIS, an open-source mapping application, and then used Python to process the data. I fed the processed data into machine learning and deep learning models to make my predictions. I chose to focus on the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, for its relatively manageable size, proximity to populated areas, and that it is east-west trending, which makes the topographic analysis easier.
